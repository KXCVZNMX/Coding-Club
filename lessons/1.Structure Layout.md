# 1. Structure of the program
So, as you've seen in the small ~~peak~~ demo I sent yesterday, the game
is basically a <span style="color: green">GREEN</span> cube trying to 
avoid other WHITE cubes. 

## Steps
1. Define a player (the <span style="color: green">green</span> cube)
2. Add functionalities to move it around
3. Define the falling objects
4. Add functionalities to make them generate periodically (or randomly) and fall down
5. Add functionalities for the objects and the players to interact (collision)
6. Add some final touches

### Example skeleton of `main`
```python
def main():
    # construct a class that contains the app (we will talk about this
    # (classes) later on)
    app = App()
    
    while app.is_running():
        # Do something, e.g. print endscreen, ask for restart
        if app.game_over():
            ...
        
        # Generate some falling blocks based on a probability
        if random.random() < spawn_chance:
            ...

        # Move the player cube
        if keys[K_LEFT]:
            player.pos[0] = ...
        if ...

        # Render graphics to the display
        draw(everything)

        # Refresh the display
        pygame.display.flip()

        # Check collision
        if player.collided(object):
            ...
```
