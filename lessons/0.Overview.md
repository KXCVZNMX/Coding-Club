# 0. Overview of the coming few weeks
Due to time constraint of only 5 sessions, I've decided to make just a
simple program, which is really just a *Crossy Roads: you are always
on the road* game.

Although it sounds simple, it still teaches you the fundamentals of 
a lot of Python (which you ***can*** carry into other
languages).

The basic layouts of these session would be (***hopefully***):
1. Define the structure of the whole app (which probably will not take the whole lesson)
2. Introduce `PyGame` and play around with it
3. Introduce the concept of `class`
4. Start to write some logic for the game
5. Add finishing touches to the game

If some contents of a lesson is not completed in the time, I will post 
things on the discord server for you guys to maybe take a read. Hopefully
everything goes to plan and this game can be made

This game may look very boring, but it really is the best we can do in 5
lessons' time (which is only like 25 minutes each)
